                        This is the website of Ceremony, which is a café and tea house located in Providence. 
                        I choose this website because I like it very much and I ordered coffee on it all the time.

                </h2>
                <div class="lists">
                    <h3 class="listtitle">
                        For the usability: 
                    </h3>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            All the categories are just very thin and small texts, not in the form of buttons, so people don’t know whether 
                            it is clickable. And people have to look at the actual text to understand what this category is for. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It does not show which category you are currently on, so it is hard for you to navigate through the website.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The text on the right is not that easy to read, because some line is longer and some line is shorter.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the tablet screen size, all the categories are squeezed into two lines where the positions of them the second 
                            line is very wired.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the phone screen size, all the categories are combined into a menu text at the top center of the page, 
                            which is tiny. Therefore, it’s very hard for people to find it and know whether it is clickable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="listtitle">
                        For the Learnability: 
                    </h3>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            Most users go to their website and either want to see their menu, or order online. However, it’s difficult to find 
                            those things immediately because they are very tiny and hard to find. It’s actually under the Online Order & Gift Card 
                            Text. Therefore, in order to help them find it quickly, this category should be highlighted.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Combining Online Order with Gift Card together makes no sense, they should be separated. It is annoying because 
                            there are too many things inside one category. So, when you go inside this category and want to find the Online 
                            order stuff, you have to find it again, which totally loses the actual meaning of using categories.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="listtitle">
                        For the Memorability: 
                    </h3>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            Most users go to their website and either want to see their menu, or order online. However, even if they know to click 
                            on these small texts as the categories, it still takes time to find which text is online ordering. Therefore, 
                            highlighting the most useful button, which is online ordering will help the user to find it easily because after using 
                            it a few times, they know to click on the highlighted one for online ordering.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        Accessibility Using WebAIM WAVE: 
                    </h3>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            It shows the website has 3 Errors which are empty links containing no text. But I think it’s fine because the links 
                            are applied to the corresponding icons to Facebook, Email, and Instagram, so the user knows what they are clicking. 
                            It also shows some alerts. For example, it shows that some of the paragraphs do not have a heading, just plain text. 
                            And I agree with that, the paragraph should have a heading to help the user better understand what the paragraph is 
                            about. It also shows there are redundant links such as the link applied to the text “about” is the website’s link 
                            itself. I think it is ok because the main page is just the “about” page so that people can return to this page from 
                            other categories.
